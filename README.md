A package for cleaning and utilizing geospatial data. Allows the use of
geospatial data to help create summarizations such as distance
calculations or rudimentary visualizations via latitude–longitude
binning.

Functions included:

-   `lat_long_distance`: calculates the distance (in kilometres) between
    two geographic points given their latitude and longitude
    coordinates.
-   `lat_long_binning`: bins latitude and longitude into different
    groups to aid in grouping or for use in `plot_binned_lat_long`.
-   `plot_binned_lat_long`: visualizes binned geographic coordinates on
    a heatmap.

`lat_long_distance` is a common function found in many packages such as
[GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[Haversine](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/). However, binning and
plotting such binned latitudes and longitudes does not currently exist.
Current methods to bin require the use of multiple `Pandas` functions to
do so. We aim to create a simplification of the binning and their plot
without the user's having to rely on multiple uses and transformation on
their part.

## What does “binning” latitude and longitude mean?

Binning latitude and longitude refers to **grouping nearby geographic
points into fixed-size grid cells**.

For example, with a grid size of `0.05°`, all points whose latitudes
fall between 49.25 and 49.30 and longitudes between −123.20 and −123.15
would be assigned to the same bin. This is useful for:

-   aggregating spatial data
-   counting observations in geographic regions
-   creating density-style visualizations (e.g., heatmaps)
-   reducing noise in very precise GPS data

## Example output

Below is an example heatmap produced by `plot_binned_lat_long`, showing
the spatial density of binned latitude–longitude points.

## Usage example

``` python
from latlonghelper import lat_long_binning
from latlonghelper import lat_long_distance
from latlonghelper import plot_binned_lat_long
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example coordinates (Vancouver area)
latitudes = [49.2606, 49.2827, 49.2685]
longitudes = [-123.2460, -123.1207, -123.1686]

# Bin coordinates
binned = []
for lat, lon in zip(latitudes, longitudes):
    binned.append(lat_long_binning(lat, lon, 0.05, 0.05))

# Plot heatmap
ax = plot_binned_lat_long(binned)
plt.show()

# Distance example
distance = lat_long_distance(49.2606, -123.2460, 49.2827, -123.1207)
print(distance)
```
