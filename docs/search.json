    "text": "A package for cleaning and utilizing geospatial data. Allows the use of geospatial data to help create summarizations such as distance or create rudimentary plots via the binning functionality included in the package.\nFunctions included: - LatLongDistance: calculates the distance (in kilometres) between two geographic points given their latitude and longitude coordinates. - LatLongBinning: bins latitude and longitude into different groups to aid in grouping or for use in PlotBinnedLatLong. - PlotBinnedLatLong: visualizes binned geographic coordinates on a heatmap.\nLatLongDistance is a common function found in many packages such as GeoPy and Haversine. However, binning and plotting such binned latitudes and longitudes does not currently exist. Current methods to bin require the use of multiple Pandas functions to do so. We aim to create a simplification of the binning and their plot without the user’s having to rely on multiple uses and transformation on their part.\n\n\nFull documentation, including API references and examples, is available at:\n👉 https://UBC-MDS.github.io/latlonghelper/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython 3.8+\npip\n\n\n\n\nClone the repository and install the package in editable mode:\ngit clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/latlonghelper\ncd latlonghelper\n\n\n\nIf you are using conda, you can create the development environment using:\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate latlonghelper-env\npip install -e .\n\n\n\n\nYou can run the tests for this package using pytest.
